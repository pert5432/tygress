Typescript ORM for Postgres, runs on Node.js

# Main goals ðŸŽ¯

- Support all Postgres features to get the most out of your database
  - Including changing Postgres config, per-table overrides, explicit locking, DDL etc...
- Have minimum performance overhead and maximum control
  - You should have full control over which columns and how many rows you select
  - It should be clear what queries are ran where so Tygress API functions aim to only execute 1 query per call
- Have full type safety
  - This includes query results, building the queries themselves and other interactions with Postgres
- Keep simple queries simple but offer solid support for building complex ones
