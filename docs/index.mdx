  - Including changing Postgres config, per-table overrides, explicit locking, DDL etc...
- Have minimum performance overhead and maximum control
  - You should have full control over which columns and how many rows you `SELECT`, `INSERT` etc...
  - It should be clear what queries are ran when and where
